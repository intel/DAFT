DAFT - Distributed Automated Flasher & Tester
=============================================

Overview
--------
DAFT is a tool for automated flashing and testing of an OS image on a real
device. Its goal is to both standardize and simplify the testing on a variety of
devices, while keeping minimal the cost and the complexity of the setup. In
particular, it strives to use only inexpensive off-the shelf hardware components
and to keep one single configuration that can be used by both large testing
farms and individual testers/developers.

This software is an evolution of the initial AFT, written by Igor Stoppa.
